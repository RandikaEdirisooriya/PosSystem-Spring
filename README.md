                                                Project Overview


This project is built using the Spring Framework, with a focus on implementing Inversion of Control (IoC) to promote loose coupling and modular design. IoC allows the application's dependencies to be managed externally from the codebase, enhancing flexibility and testability. The framework provides a container that handles the configuration and lifecycle of the applicationâ€™s components (or beans), allowing developers to focus on business logic. By leveraging IoC, this project minimizes hard-coded dependencies, promotes scalability, and ensures a clean architecture. Additionally, this approach simplifies future enhancements by providing centralized configuration management, either through XML files or Java annotations.
